# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

mint21-wolfsberg:8555 {
	# Set this path to your site's directory.
	# root * /opt/wolfsberg/directus

	# Enable the static file server.
	# file_server

	# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
	reverse_proxy localhost:8055
	tls internal

	# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
	# php_fastcgi localhost:9000
