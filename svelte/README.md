### Added by me

I have kept articles but added a membersOnly attribute. Articles is public so can be read by visitors but the get filters
on the membersOnly attribute == false. After authentication, a members only link is displayed, which gets members articles.

This is probably not the best way to do this. Better would be to have two tables - articles and membersArticles. Identical fields.

This would allow articles to be public and memberArticles to be private and so require authentication. And it would protect when the rest api is used.

But it does mean a lot of duplication.


To work on network, change vite.config.js

add - server: host: true
Also add https and cert location
